I am now a Assistant Researcher at the institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.  In June 2018, I received my PHD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), supervised by Prof. Chengqing Zong. Prior to this, I received my BS degree from Northeastern University in June 2013.

My research interests are natural language understaning, including textual semantic analysis, representation learning, human language understanding.

# News

Two papers "Associative Multichannel Autoencoder for Multimodal Word Representation" and "Memory, Show the Way: Memory Based Few Shot Word Representation Learning" have been accepted by EMNLP2019!

(24/5/2018) Successfully defended my PHD thesis "Learning Vector representations for Words, Phrases and Sentences".
